const { createRPCQueryClient } = juno.ClientFactory;
const client = await createRPCQueryClient({ rpcEndpoint: RPC_ENDPOINT });

// now you can query the cosmos modules
const balance = await client.cosmos.bank.v1beta1
    .allBalances({ address: 'juno1addresshere' });

// you can also query params
const response = await client.juno.mint.params();
response.params.blocksPerYear
```
